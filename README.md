A go package for processing shapesets.

Shapesets are basically collections of 3D meshes which define a set of exclusive 3D shapes within a volume, and can be composed to create a complete surface of any subset of those shapes for the purpose of visualisation.

## build

    go build -o shapesetcli src/github.com/nat-n/shapeset/cli/main.go
